Image Chooser for the excellent NextGEN Gallery, based on g2image 

== Description ==

[NextGEN Gallery](http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/) is an excellent gallery for WordPress. Its major drawback, as far as I'm concerned, is the minimalistic image chooser.
So I've taken the liberty to adapt the equally excellent [g2image](http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/) image chooser, which also is embedded in the WPG2 connector to Gallery2.

At present, only the main tags [album], [nggallery], [thumb], and [singlepic], plus some html links are supported, and only the height and width options. Also, presently there is no elegant way to set the default values, you would have to edit the init.php file.

But as I think that the plugin already is helpful as it is, I'm offering it to you and will add further features, as time permits.
               
== Installation ==

1. Upload the `nextgen-ic` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In the visual editor, you will find a new NGG button which allows adding albums, galleries and images to the post
